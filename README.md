# Assignment 1: Multi-Layer Perceptron for Image Classification 

## Aim

To implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron from scratch using only NumPy. The network is trained on MNIST or Fashion-MNIST datasets.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand forward and backward propagation
- Implement gradient computation manually
- Implement various optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adam, Nadam)
- Work with activation functions and their derivatives
- Train and evaluate neural networks
- Log experiments using Weights & Biases
